# Installing `pymodbus`

To use the `pymodbus` library for Modbus communication, follow these steps:

## 1. Install via pip
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pymodbus
```

## 2. Verify Installation
To check if `pymodbus` is installed, run:

```bash
pip show pymodbus
```

If installed, you should see output with package details like version and location.

## 3. Alternative: Install a Specific Version
If you need a specific version of `pymodbus` (e.g., version `2.5.3`), use:

```

## 4. Check for Installation Issues
If you encounter issues, ensure `pip` is up-to-date by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
